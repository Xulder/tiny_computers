# CPU Emulator

A sophisticated CPU emulator implementation written in Rust, focusing on accurate register and instruction emulation with a modular architecture.

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive CPU emulation framework that simulates processor behavior through:
- Register operations and state management
- Flexible instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Memory management with device mapping
- Error handling and debugging capabilities

## Features

### Core CPU Components
- Complete CPU state management
- Flexible register file implementation
- Flag register support
- Cycle-accurate execution

### Memory System
- Modular memory device architecture
- Memory mapping capabilities
- Support for ROM and RAM devices
- Memory bus implementation for device management

### Instruction Set Architecture
- Extensible instruction set framework
- Multiple addressing modes
- Instruction encoding/decoding
- Support for various instruction categories:
  - Arithmetic
  - Logic
  - Data Transfer
  - Control Flow
  - Stack Operations
  - I/O Operations
  - System Instructions

### Development Tools
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Commitizen for standardized commit messages
- Automated changelog generation
- Comprehensive error handling
